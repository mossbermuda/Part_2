## First Application: WordSwag
[Link to application](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/word-swag-cool-fonts/id645746786?mt=8)

WordSwag provides users with a convenient way of adding text to images on their smartphone. This application uses a single payment model that unlocks all features to the user; updates and additional fonts are then provided at no extra cost. Images can be chosen directly from the user’s photo library or from a set of default templates within the application itself. Users can choose from a slue of different fonts by using a horizontal slider. The layout of the chosen font can then be changed using five provided options including a randomization tool. Fonts can be repositioned or resized by dragging and pinching them. To edit the font the user simply double taps on the font and an editor window appears. After the desired outcome and look is reached the image can be exported and saved directly to the photo library on the phone. Afterwards additional fonts or watermarks can be added if desired.

This application is useful to individuals or companies that create and share media content and are looking for an inexpensive way of adding fonts or watermarks to their images on their phones. The application looks to eliminate the need to use computer applications (such as Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop). WordSwag leverages the convenience and mobility of a smartphone to allow a user to quickly add font or watermarks to an image and share it. The touch screen provides an intuitive interface that creates a quick and efficient work flow. 

I personally have been using this application for about a year and I can confidently say it has several strengths that can be useful to users familiar and unfamiliar with graphic design. Choosing an image to edit is familiar as it uses the native photo library UI, editing and choosing fonts are a breeze, and it provides users with a wide selection of font types. This selection of premade fonts is also the applications biggest weakness. Whereas other computer based applications allow the user to create virtually any font possible, WordSwag confines the user to a limited selection of fonts. A potential improvement could be to allow users to add to the list of fonts or select from a library of community made fonts.

**First Heuristic Evaluation: Aesthetic and Minimalistic Design**
Very few labels and informative text is used in the design of WordSwag. Much of the mechanics seem natural and take great advantage of the touch screen interface. To move a font you drag and resize it to where you want. There are no dials or number input boxes; much of the editing is freehand. WordSwag uses clever ways of displaying information such as having the font selection be on horizontal slider, or the fact that they tell the user how to edit text by having the first text appear to be informative: ‘double tap me to change text’. Intuitively the user will attempt to double tap the text and a new editor window will appear. Overall the application avoids drowning the user in information like many computer applications with similar functions do.

**Second Heuristic Evaluation: Help and Documentation**
Some help is provided through hints in the UI but generally documentation is not observed. Much of the interaction found in the application is learned through experimentation and clever hints provided by the application. I believe the intended audience of the application will be able to pick up the functionality rather quickly but people unfamiliar with applications similar to this may take longer to pick it up.


## Second Application: Hill Climb Racing

Hill Climb Racing is a mobile physics based racing game. It uses the free-to-play model along with in-app advertisements and purchases. The player starts off with one vehicle and one map. The objective of the game is to travel as far as you can on the map without hitting your head or running out of gas. During the run the player can pick up coins and fuel. A point system is used to reward the player at the end of each run. Points are earned based on tricks performed, distance travelled, and coins collected. Points are then converted to coins that can be spent on upgrading your vehicles, purchasing new vehicles, and purchasing new maps. Each vehicle has specific attributes that can be improved such as grip, speed, fuel efficiency, and downforce. Upgrading your vehicle is key to travelling further and collecting more coins in order to buy more vehicles and more maps. This simple mobile game quickly turns into an inevitably addictive cycle.

This app appeals to users who like to play games on their phone or are looking for a free way to kill a couple minutes. I chose this application because it is a good representation of how simplicity of design can lead to success in the app store. The objective of the game is simple enough for any user to understand within the first few minutes of playing and the absence of a pay wall allows the app to reach a larger audience. In app purchases allow people who want to progress through the game quickly to purchase coins to buy upgrades, maps, and vehicles. Hill Climb takes advantage of very simple input mechanics: a gas button and brake button. Gas accelerates the player’s vehicle and rotates the vehicle left while mid-air. Brake slows the player and rotates the player right mid-air. Together these make for easy to use controls that are quick to learn.

This mobile game’s strength is its simplistic UI and controls. They make it extremely easy to pickup and traverse through the menus. A weakness of the game is that it becomes repetitive very quickly. A suggested improvement might be to add different game modes that involve different objectives. The game is intended for 5-20 minutes of gameplay at a time but perhaps different game modes would increase play time and app usage.

**First Heuristic Evaluation: Recognition Rather Than Recall**
The simplistic design of the menu system becomes very fluid and takes only a few minutes to get used to (if that). The flow of selection is very logical with a ‘next’ button located in the same position on each screen; the player can select their car, select the map they wish to play on, and lastly choose any upgrades they wish to purchase before beginning. A button found on the left-hand side represents the ‘previous selection’ button informing the player of where they have been. It becomes second nature to begin a game and make the desired selections. Throughout the whole process of beginning a game each screen provides the user with enough information for them to know where they are, expect where they’ll be next, and remember where they’ve been. If an option such as map or vehicle needs to be changed it’s only one or two button clicks away.

**Second Heuristic Evaluation: Consistency and Standards**
The menu and gameplay UI follow a very consistent layout. Different screens will display titles in the same locations, buttons will be reused and appear in the same location or merely have text within them changed to help inform the player of the current system status. Each screen appears familiar to one another with only subtle differences or change in content. Button naming and design is logical allowing ambiguity to be avoided. Colors and fonts used remain the same throughout the menus as well.
